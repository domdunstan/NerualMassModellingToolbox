# NerualMassModellingToolbox
This repository contains code to generate figures and run the algorithms described in Dunstan et al. (2023) "Global nonlinear approach for mapping parameters of neural mass models". 

The repository comes in two parts. 
1. To provide a platform for the implementation of single and multi objective evolutionary algorithms on
 neural mass models, as decirbed in the paper. 
2. To reproduce the results figures in the paper from saved datasets.

This software uses a number of external toolboxes. We are grateful to the 
authors of these toolboxes. In each case, the licenses are stated within the corresponding header.

See 'Dunstan_et_al_algorithms' for applying single and multiobjecitve evolutionary algorithms to data. See the Methods section in the manuscript for details.

See 'Dunstan_et_al_figures' for recreating all results figures from the paper.
